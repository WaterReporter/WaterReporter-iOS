Matthew Logan became President &amp; Potomac Riverkeeper in January 2013. Matt brings to this position a wealth of experience in river protection and public engagement, as well as success in running nonprofit organizations. As President of Potomac Conservancy from 1998 to 2006, Matthew secured permanent protection for over 50 properties in the Potomac watershed totaling nearly 10,000 acres and created numerous educational programs. In addition, Matthew secured the protection of six major Potomac River Islands.

SHENANDOAH RIVERKEEPER
The Shenandoah River is the largest river that flows into the Potomac River. Shenandoah Riverkeeper uses community action and enforcement to protect and restore water quality in the Shenandoah Valley for people, fish, and aquatic life.

Jeff Kelble stepped out of his fishing guide raft and into conservation work at the end of 2005 when he started the Shenandoah Riverkeeper Program and become the Shenandoah Riverkeeper.

Before he became Shenandoah Riverkeeper, Jeff worked for 8 years to build a private smallmouth bass guiding business and a bed and breakfast. After years of fish kills devastated the Shenandoah Riverâ€™s fishery, Jeff decided to put down his oars to join the fight for the river and its health.

Jeff focused on investigating fish health problems and quickly became a regional expert and advocate. Jeff now spends much of his time scouring the river and the land for pollution sources and fighting to stop pollution with legal enforcement and community action.
